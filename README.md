# UPES-Semester-5
- This repository belongs to the Fifth semester of my college.
- This semester contained a lot of important subjects like Algorithms for Intelligent Systems and Robotics, Neural Networks, and Microprocessors and Embedded Systems.
- This repo contains the codes for all the assignments, I got for these subjects.
- Happy Coding üßëüèª‚Äçüíª.....
