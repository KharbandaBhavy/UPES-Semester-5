# UPES-Semester-5
- This repository belongs to the Fifth semester of my college.
- This semester contained a lot of important subjects like Algorithms for Intelligent Systems and Robotics, Neural Networks, and Microprocessors and Embedded Systems.
- This repo contains the codes for all the assignments, I got for these subjects.
- Happy Coding 🧑🏻‍💻.....


## Algorithms for Intelligent Systems and Robotics 🤖
### Approximate idea of Experiments for Algorithms for Intelligent Systems and Robotics folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.
- Experiment-1: To understand the concept of designing issue related to the database with creating, populating the tables. Also familiarize students with different ways of manipulation in database.


## Neural Networks Lab 🥅
### Approximate idea of Experiments for Machine Learning folder. Although, the doc of detailed problem statements is also added in the folder.
- Exp-1: Write any five programs based on python to refresh the concepts studied earlier.
