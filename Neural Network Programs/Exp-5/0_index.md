Demonstrate the implementation Conv, Pool, Activation, Fully connected layers

# 1. Original Code file, Convolutional Network with one pooling layer(Lab 5).
# 2. Lab 5 - Modification using the CIFAR 100 dataset using history and previous learning rate.
# 3. Original Code file, Convolutional Network with multiple pooling layer(Lab 5N).
# 4. Lab 5N - Modification using the CIFAR 100 dataset with the same method as original.
