Experiment No.3- Introduction to pytorch neural networks
Explore the tools with different options like:

# 1.Creating a dataset
# 2.Applying neural network on that dataset.
# 3.Using pytorch(inbuilt functions) on that dataset
# 4.Applying logistic regression by changing the error calculation method.
# 5.Predicting the accuracy of the train-test models.
